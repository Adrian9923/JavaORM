Your task is to create a database for a University System, using the Code First approach.

In the database, we should keep information about students, teachers, and courses.

The database should have the following tables:

Student (id, first name, last name, phone number, average grade, attendance)

Teacher (id, first name, last name, phone number, email, salary per hour)

Course (id, name, description, start date, end date, credits)

The relationships between the tables are as follows:

Each student can be enrolled in many courses and each course, many students can be enrolled

A teacher can teach in many courses but one course can be taught only by one teacher

Use class hierarchy to reduce code duplication
